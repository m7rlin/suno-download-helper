    "style": "This remix transforms the emotive ballad into a club anthem, opening with chopped vocal hooks over pulsing house beats. Lush synth layers, soaring leads, and a driving bassline carry the infectious groove. Strategic breakdowns retain raw emotion before launching back into high-energy drops.",

    "style": "A melancholic folk-rock ballad in a minor key, featuring a male vocalist with a smooth, slightly raspy baritone. The instrumentation is sparse, primarily acoustic, with a clean electric guitar playing arpeggiated chords and a subtle, sustained pad providing atmospheric depth. A gentle, almost brushed drum beat enters later in the song, maintaining a slow tempo. The chord progression is simple and repetitive, contributing to the reflective mood. The vocal melody is understated, focusing on emotional delivery rather than complex runs. The production is clean and spacious, allowing each instrument to breathe, with a slight reverb on the vocals and guitar to enhance the ethereal quality. The song builds subtly in intensity towards the end, with the addition of a second, higher vocal harmony and a more prominent drum rhythm, before fading out with the sustained pad and arpeggiated guitar.",

    "style": "A high-energy, emotionally intense indie rock song inspired by Idlewild’s “Little Discourage.” Fast tempo, punchy guitars with both jangly and distorted layers, and driving live drums. Vocals are raw yet melodic, sung with urgency and a subtle Scottish accent — full of self-reflection, frustration, and restless energy. The lyrics should feel poetic and confessional, blending vivid imagery with emotional honesty. The chorus should soar with a desperate, anthemic quality — something that sounds cathartic and alive. Think poetic punk meeting melodic alternative rock, with a tense verse buildup exploding into a big chorus.\n\nVocal notes:\nAccent Strength: Heavy (70–80%) — thick Scottish delivery, but musical and emotional, Consonants: Drop or soften final “g” — “settlin’, ” “cryin’, ” etc",

    "style": "Acoustic folk rock song in the key of A minor at a tempo of 100 beats per minute. The primary instrumentation is an acoustic guitar playing a fingerpicked arpeggiated chord progression throughout the song. The guitar provides both rhythmic and harmonic foundation. The vocals are a male baritone, delivered with a clear, slightly melancholic tone. The song structure consists of verses and a recurring chorus-like section. There are no drums or bass. The mixing is dry with minimal effects, emphasizing the natural acoustic sound of the guitar and the raw quality of the vocals. The melody is simple and follows the chord changes closely, with a narrow vocal range.",

    "style": "A whimsical, narrative-driven piece in a musical theater style, featuring a male tenor lead supported by a mixed chorus. The instrumentation includes a harpsichord, strings, and percussion, creating a baroque pop sound. The song is in a major key with a moderate tempo, characterized by a clear, bright timbre. The harpsichord provides a continuous, arpeggiated accompaniment, while the strings offer sustained harmonies and occasional melodic counterpoints. Percussion is light, primarily marking the beat. The lead vocal is clear and articulate, with a storytelling quality, while the chorus provides harmonic backing, often in unison or simple harmonies. The song structure is verse-chorus, with some spoken word elements and a clear narrative progression. The production is clean, with a focus on vocal clarity and instrumental balance, creating an intimate yet theatrical atmosphere.",

    "style": "The piece is a male vocal a cappella arrangement with a barbershop quartet style. The lead vocal is a baritone, with three other male voices providing close harmonies. The tempo is moderate, and the key is C major. The vocal arrangement features a call-and-response structure in some sections, with the lead baritone often taking the melody. The harmonies are rich and consonant, typical of barbershop. There are no instrumental elements, and the production is dry, emphasizing the natural vocal timbres and blend. The song structure follows a verse-chorus format with some spoken word interjections. The melody is memorable and singable, with a clear tonal center. The overall mood is lighthearted and theatrical.",

    "style": "A male vocalist sings a narrative in a baritone range, accompanied by a string orchestra, a brass section, and a percussion section. The song is in a minor key and maintains a moderate tempo throughout. The vocal delivery is clear and articulate, with a storytelling quality. The string section provides a rich harmonic foundation, often playing sustained chords and melodic counterpoints. The brass section adds emphasis and dramatic flair, particularly during key lyrical phrases. Percussion, including snare drum and cymbals, provides rhythmic drive and accents. The arrangement features dynamic shifts, with sections building in intensity and then receding. The overall production is clean, with a focus on the vocal clarity and the orchestral textures. There are no significant electronic effects or modern production techniques. The song structure follows a verse-chorus format with some spoken word interjections.",

    "style": "A whimsical, narrative-driven piece in a musical theater style, featuring a male tenor lead supported by a male chorus. The instrumentation includes a harpsichord, strings, and percussion, creating a baroque pop sound. The song is in a major key with a moderate tempo, characterized by a clear, bright timbre. The harpsichord provides a continuous, arpeggiated accompaniment, while the strings offer sustained harmonies and occasional melodic counterpoints. Percussion is light, primarily marking the beat. The lead vocal is clear and articulate, with a storytelling quality, while the chorus provides harmonic backing, often in unison or simple harmonies. The song structure is verse-chorus, with some spoken word elements and a clear narrative progression. The production is clean, with a focus on vocal clarity and instrumental balance, creating an intimate yet theatrical atmosphere.",

    "style": "A theatrical pop song with a moderate tempo and a clear, bright production. The instrumentation features a prominent piano playing a waltz-like accompaniment, a string section providing lush harmonies, and a subtle percussion section with a light snare drum. The lead vocal is a male baritone, delivered with a clear, almost spoken-word quality in the verses, transitioning to a more melodic and sustained delivery in the chorus. The song is in a major key, with a simple, repetitive chord progression that emphasizes the melodic lines. The overall mood is whimsical and slightly melancholic, with a clear narrative progression. The mixing is balanced, with the vocals prominent and the instruments providing a supportive, yet distinct, background. There are no significant effects on the vocals, maintaining a natural sound. The song structure is verse-chorus with a clear intro and outro.",

    "style": "A warm, organic indie folk song built around violin loops, fingerpicked acoustic guitar, upright bass, brushed drums, and glockenspiel, Include expressive whistling interludes that echo the vocal melody, The vocals are clear, articulate, and slightly dry in tone — sung with gentle precision and subtle vibrato, thoughtful and literate in phrasing, with a hint of playfulness, Harmonies are soft and close, blending naturally into the mix, The arrangement feels handmade and intimate, with analog warmth, natural room reverb, and rich stereo detail, The overall mood is introspective yet lightly whimsical, capturing charm and intelligence.",

    "style": "The song is a melancholic folk-rock piece featuring a male vocalist with a baritone range. The primary instrumentation consists of an acoustic guitar playing a consistent chord progression throughout the song. The guitar has a warm, slightly reverbed tone. The vocals are delivered in a conversational, slightly weary manner, with some vocal fry present. The song structure is verse-based with a recurring vocal phrase that functions similarly to a chorus. There are no distinct instrumental breaks or solos. The tempo is slow and consistent. The key appears to be G major. The production is simple and dry, focusing on the acoustic guitar and vocals with minimal effects.",

    "style": "A child's voice, male, speaks in a conversational tone, describing objects and sounds. The vocal quality is clear and close-miked, suggesting an intimate recording environment. The tempo is slow and deliberate, dictated by the child's speech patterns. There are no discernible musical instruments or chord progressions. The soundscape is dominated by the child's voice and occasional background noises, which include a distinct clicking sound that occurs intermittently throughout the recording. The overall production is raw and unpolished, characteristic of a home recording or field recording, with no apparent mixing or mastering effects applied. The structure is free-form, following the child's stream of consciousness as they identify and name various items. The key is undefined due to the absence of melodic elements. The dynamic range is relatively narrow, focusing on the child's vocal delivery.",

    "style": "A children's song with a simple, repetitive melody. The primary instrument is a ukulele, providing a light, acoustic accompaniment. The vocal performance is by a young child, characterized by a high-pitched, somewhat off-key delivery, typical of early childhood singing. The song structure is informal, with repeated phrases and a conversational tone. The tempo is moderate, and the key appears to be C major, though the vocal pitch wavers. There are no complex chord progressions or production effects; the recording is raw and unmixed, capturing the natural acoustics of the environment.",

Include expressive whistling interludes that echo the vocal melody. The vocals are clear, articulate, and slightly dry in tone — sung with gentle precision and subtle vibrato, thoughtful and literate in phrasing, with a hint of playfulness. Harmonies are soft and close, blending naturally into the mix. The arrangement feels handmade and intimate, with analog warmth, natural room reverb, and rich stereo detail. The overall mood is introspective yet lightly whimsical, capturing charm and intelligence.",

Dynamic, dramatic, and intellectual, yet still soulful and swinging. The production should feel live, as if recorded in a concert hall, with natural reverb and crisp clarity, highlighting the tension and dialogue between the classical orchestra and the jazz ensemble.",

    "style": "A high-energy electronic dance music track with a driving beat and a dark, futuristic atmosphere. The song features a prominent synth bassline, a consistent four-on-the-floor kick drum, and a variety of synthesized percussion elements including hi-hats, snares, and claps. The tempo is fast, around 130 BPM. The key is minor, contributing to the dark mood. The song structure includes distinct verse and chorus sections, with instrumental breaks. The vocals are male, delivered in a spoken-word style with a robotic, heavily processed effect, creating a dystopian feel. Production elements include heavy reverb on the vocals and some synth pads, creating a spacious yet intense soundscape. The overall mix is clear, with the bass and drums providing a solid foundation for the synth melodies and processed vocals.",

    "style": "A high-energy electronic rock track with a driving beat and prominent synth melodies. The song features a male vocalist with a clear, slightly gritty tone, delivering lyrics with a sense of urgency and defiance. The instrumentation includes a powerful drum machine providing a consistent, upbeat rhythm, a pulsating bassline, and various synthesizers creating melodic hooks and atmospheric pads. The chord progression is generally minor-key focused, contributing to a dramatic and slightly melancholic feel, despite the energetic tempo. Production elements include a clean mix with a strong emphasis on the lead vocals and synth lines, and a moderate amount of reverb on the vocals to add depth. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format with instrumental breaks and a build-up towards the end. The tempo is fast, creating a sense of forward momentum throughout the piece.",

    "style": "This is an upbeat, high-energy electronic dance music track with a driving beat and a prominent synth melody. The tempo is fast, around 130 BPM. The key is minor, creating a sense of urgency and excitement. The instrumentation primarily consists of electronic drums, a pulsating bassline, and various synthesizers. The drums feature a strong four-on-the-floor kick, a consistent snare on the backbeats, and a fast-paced hi-hat pattern. The bassline is a continuous, arpeggiated synth bass providing a strong rhythmic and harmonic foundation. Synthesizers play both melodic lines and atmospheric pads. The main melody is catchy and repetitive, often featuring a call-and-response structure. There are occasional vocal samples and ad-libs, heavily processed with auto-tune and reverb, adding to the electronic feel. The song structure is typical of EDM, with verses, choruses, and instrumental breaks that build tension and release. Production is clean and polished, with a wide stereo image and a strong emphasis on rhythmic clarity. The mixing highlights the synth melodies and bass, with the vocals sitting slightly above the instrumental track. Effects like reverb, delay, and distortion are used to enhance the electronic textures.",

    "style": "Acoustic rock song in a major key at a moderate tempo. The song features a male vocalist with a clear, slightly raspy baritone voice, accompanied by an acoustic guitar. The guitar plays a driving rhythm with a consistent strumming pattern, occasionally incorporating arpeggiated chords. The vocal melody is conversational and slightly melancholic, with a narrow range. The song structure is verse-chorus, with a bridge section that introduces a more reflective mood. Production is clean, with the acoustic guitar and vocals prominent in the mix. There are no drums or bass, giving the song an intimate, stripped-down feel. The song includes spoken word elements and vocal ad-libs that add to its raw, unpolished character.",

    "style": "The piece is an instrumental track with a fast tempo, featuring a blend of electronic and orchestral elements. The primary melody is carried by a synth lead with a bright, almost chiptune-like quality, supported by a driving drum beat that incorporates both electronic percussion and orchestral timpani. There are prominent brass sections, including trumpets and trombones, playing fanfare-like motifs. String sections provide a lush, sweeping background, often playing sustained chords or counter-melodies. The bassline is provided by a synth bass, giving a solid rhythmic and harmonic foundation. The overall structure is episodic, moving through various melodic and harmonic ideas with a sense of continuous build-up and excitement. Production elements include a clear, bright mix with a wide stereo image, and some reverb on the orchestral elements to create a sense of space. The key appears to be in a major mode, contributing to the uplifting and heroic feel.",

    "style": "A high-energy rock track with a driving tempo of approximately 140 BPM, featuring a male vocalist with a raw, slightly distorted delivery. The song is in a minor key, likely E minor, with a prominent guitar riff that uses power chords and a wah effect. The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The guitar plays a consistent, rhythmic riff throughout the verses and choruses, characterized by a slightly overdriven tone. The bass provides a solid, driving low end, often mirroring the guitar's root notes. The drums feature a strong backbeat with a consistent kick and snare pattern, punctuated by cymbal crashes. The vocal melody is relatively simple and repetitive, emphasizing the rhythmic drive of the song. Production elements include a clear, punchy mix with the vocals sitting prominently in the foreground, and a noticeable reverb on the vocals and guitars, contributing to a spacious, arena-rock feel. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format with an instrumental break. The overall mood is energetic and slightly rebellious.",

The drums provide a consistent, powerful beat with prominent snare and kick. The bass guitar plays a foundational, often root-note-driven line, contributing to the song's aggressive feel. Electric guitars are heavily distorted, playing both rhythmic power chords and melodic lead lines. The lead guitar often employs a wah effect and bends. The male vocals are delivered with a raw, slightly strained quality, conveying a sense of urgency and angst. The song structure includes verses, a pre-chorus, and a chorus, with instrumental breaks featuring guitar solos. Production elements include heavy compression on drums and guitars, creating a dense, powerful sound. The mix emphasizes the guitars and vocals, with the rhythm section providing a solid backbone. The overall mood is intense and rebellious.",

    "style": "The piece is an instrumental composition featuring a prominent pizzicato string melody, supported by a driving percussion section. The tempo is moderately fast. The primary melody is carried by a pizzicato string section, creating a light and playful feel. The percussion provides a consistent rhythmic foundation, characterized by a steady beat and occasional fills. The overall mood is energetic and slightly whimsical. The arrangement is relatively sparse, allowing the pizzicato strings to remain at the forefront of the mix. There are no discernible chord progressions in the provided segment, as the focus is on the melodic line and rhythmic drive. The production emphasizes clarity and separation of instruments.",

    "style": "This piece is an electronic track with a driving, somewhat chaotic energy. It features a prominent, distorted synth bass line that provides a strong rhythmic foundation. Percussion consists of electronic drum samples, including a kick, snare, and hi-hat, often with a fast, almost breakbeat-like pattern. There are various synth lead melodies and arpeggiated synth lines that weave throughout the track, contributing to its frenetic feel. Vocal samples are used as rhythmic and textural elements, often heavily processed and chopped, creating a sense of urgency and sometimes disorientation. The overall tempo is fast, contributing to the high-energy atmosphere. Production elements include heavy use of distortion, filtering, and possibly some delay and reverb on the synth elements. The mix is dense, with many layers of electronic sounds. The structure appears to be somewhat free-form, with sections building in intensity and then shifting to new rhythmic or melodic ideas, rather than adhering to a strict verse-chorus form. There are moments of spoken word samples that add a narrative, albeit fragmented, quality.",

    "style": "A high-energy, instrumental piece with a driving rhythm section and prominent melodic lines. The primary instruments are a clean electric guitar, a bass guitar, and a drum kit. The guitar plays a fast, intricate melody with a slightly overdriven tone, utilizing a tremolo bar for expressive bends. The bass provides a solid, walking bass line, anchoring the harmony and rhythm. The drums feature a consistent rock beat with frequent cymbal crashes and snare fills, maintaining a brisk tempo. The song structure is largely repetitive, with variations in the guitar melody and occasional drum fills. The overall feel is upbeat and adventurous, reminiscent of surf rock or spy movie themes. The production is clean, with all instruments clearly audible and well-balanced in the mix. The tempo is approximately 160 BPM. The key appears to be E minor, with a strong emphasis on melodic minor scales.",

The overall production is clean and polished, with a clear separation of instruments in the mix. The track maintains a consistent energy throughout, with subtle variations in the synth melody and occasional fills from the drum machine.

    "style": "A high-energy, instrumental electronic dance music track with a driving beat and a prominent synth melody. The tempo is fast, around 140 BPM, with a 4/4 time signature. The primary instruments are synthesizers, drums, and a bassline. The drums feature a strong kick and snare pattern, typical of EDM, with a consistent hi-hat rhythm. The bassline is a pulsating synth bass, providing a solid rhythmic and harmonic foundation. The main melody is played by a bright, arpeggiated synthesizer, creating a sense of urgency and excitement. There are no chord progressions in the traditional sense, but the melodic lines imply a minor key, possibly D minor, due to the dark yet energetic feel. Production elements include a clean mix with clear separation of instruments, a moderate amount of reverb on the synths, and a slight compression on the overall track to enhance its punchiness. The structure is primarily a continuous build-up of energy, with no distinct verse-chorus structure, but rather a continuous flow of melodic and rhythmic development. The piece features a consistent dynamic level, maintaining its intensity throughout.",

    "style": "A high-energy, instrumental electronic dance track with a driving beat and a prominent synth melody. The tempo is fast, around 130 BPM. The key is minor, creating a sense of urgency and excitement. The song features a strong four-on-the-floor kick drum, a consistent hi-hat pattern, and a pulsating bassline that provides a solid rhythmic foundation. Synthesizers play both the main melody and supporting harmonic pads. The main melody is catchy and repetitive, evolving slightly with subtle variations and additional layers as the song progresses. Production elements include reverb on the synths, creating a spacious feel, and a slight compression on the drums to give them punch. The song structure is primarily verse-chorus-like, with distinct sections marked by changes in melodic complexity and rhythmic intensity. There are no vocals. The overall feel is energetic and suitable for dancing.",

    "style": "A high-energy, instrumental electronic dance music track with a driving beat and a prominent synth melody. The song features a fast tempo, a 4/4 time signature, and a bright, major key. The primary instrumentation includes a synthesized lead melody, a pulsating bassline, and a drum machine providing a consistent kick, snare, and hi-hat pattern. The song structure is cyclical, with the main melodic theme repeating throughout, punctuated by subtle variations in the synth arpeggiation and occasional filter sweeps on the lead synth. There are no chord progressions in the traditional sense, but rather a continuous melodic and rhythmic loop. The production is clean and polished, with a clear separation of instruments in the mix. The overall feel is upbeat and energetic, suitable for a dance environment.",

    "style": "A theatrical pop song with a moderate tempo and a clear, bright production. The instrumentation features a prominent piano playing a waltz-like accompaniment, a string section providing lush harmonies, and a subtle percussion section with a light snare drum. The lead vocal is a male baritone, delivered with a clear, almost spoken-word quality in the verses, transitioning to a more melodic and sustained delivery in the chorus. The song is in a major key, with a simple, repetitive chord progression that emphasizes the melodic lines. The overall mood is whimsical and slightly melancholic, with a clear narrative progression. The mixing is balanced, with the vocals prominent and the instruments providing a supportive, yet distinct, background. There are no significant effects on the vocals, maintaining a natural sound. The song structure is verse-chorus with a clear intro and outro.",

The song opens with a clean electric guitar playing a arpeggiated chord progression, establishing a somber mood. A bass guitar enters, providing a simple, supportive root-note line. Drums join with a sparse, understated beat, primarily using kick and snare with occasional cymbal accents. The vocal melody is largely syllabic, delivered with a reflective and slightly mournful tone. The song structure is verse-chorus, with instrumental breaks that allow the guitar to carry the melodic weight. The production is clean, with a natural reverb on the vocals and a balanced mix that highlights the individual instruments. The tempo is slow, contributing to the introspective atmosphere. The chord progression is predominantly diatonic within the minor key, utilizing common minor key harmonies. There are no significant production effects beyond standard mixing and mastering techniques.",

    "style": "A quirky, theatrical musical piece in a minor key, featuring a male vocalist with a clear, somewhat nasal tenor voice. The instrumentation primarily consists of a pizzicato string section, a piano playing arpeggiated chords, and a prominent glockenspiel providing a whimsical counter-melody. The tempo is moderate, around 120 BPM. The song structure is verse-based with no distinct chorus. The vocal delivery is conversational and slightly dramatic, with some spoken word elements. Production is clean with a focus on acoustic instrument clarity. The overall mood is inquisitive and slightly melancholic, with a touch of dark humor.",

The tempo is slow, around 60 beats per minute, and the key is A minor. The piano carries the main melodic theme, characterized by flowing arpeggios and sustained chords, creating a sense of introspection. The string section provides a rich harmonic bed, with sustained pads and occasional counter-melodies that swell and recede, adding depth and emotional weight. The production is clean and spacious, allowing each instrument to breathe, with a natural reverb that enhances the classical feel. There are no percussive elements. The piece follows an A-B-A structure, with the B section introducing a slightly more complex harmonic progression before returning to the initial theme.",

    "style": "A high-energy, instrumental electronic dance music track with a driving beat and a prominent synth melody. The tempo is fast, around 140 BPM. The key is minor, creating a sense of urgency and excitement. The primary instruments are synthesizers, drums, and bass. The drum machine provides a consistent four-on-the-floor kick drum, a snare on beats two and four, and a fast-paced hi-hat pattern. The bassline is a pulsating synth bass, providing a strong rhythmic foundation. The main melody is played by a bright, arpeggiated synthesizer, which is layered with other synth pads and leads to create a rich harmonic texture. The song structure is typical of EDM, with an intro, a main section featuring the primary melody, and a breakdown section with less instrumentation before building back up. Production elements include heavy compression on the drums, reverb on the synths, and a sidechain compression effect on the bassline, creating a pumping feel.",

    "style": "A solo pipe organ piece in a classical style, featuring a bright, clear tone. The tempo is moderate, with a consistent, flowing rhythm. The harmony is largely diatonic, employing common chord progressions. The melody is prominent and lyrical, often moving in stepwise motion with occasional larger leaps for emphasis. The piece maintains a consistent dynamic level throughout, suggesting a full organ registration. There are no discernible production effects or mixing techniques applied beyond the natural acoustics of the instrument.",

    "style": "A high-energy, instrumental chiptune piece with a driving, upbeat tempo. The primary melody is carried by a bright, synthesized lead, reminiscent of 8-bit video game music. A prominent bassline provides a strong rhythmic foundation, often playing in octaves. Percussion consists of synthesized drums, including a kick, snare, and hi-hat, maintaining a consistent, fast rhythm. The harmony is built on a major key, creating a cheerful and optimistic mood. The song structure is cyclical, with repeating melodic phrases and variations. Production is clean and crisp, emphasizing the distinct synthesized timbres.",

    "style": "A classical choral piece with a male lead tenor and a mixed choir. The piece is in a major key, likely C major, with a slow tempo. The instrumentation includes a full orchestral accompaniment with prominent strings, brass, and woodwinds, along with a pipe organ. The vocal arrangement features a lead tenor singing the main melody, supported by a four-part mixed choir providing rich harmonies. The choir's dynamics swell and recede, creating a sense of grandeur and intimacy. The production is clean with a wide stereo image, emphasizing the natural acoustics of a large hall. Reverb is used extensively to enhance the sense of space. The piece follows a traditional hymn-like structure with verses and a recurring chorus. The melody is lyrical and flowing, with a strong sense of resolution at the end of phrases. The harmony is largely diatonic, with occasional chromatic passing tones for color. The overall mood is reverent and uplifting.",

The piece features a male choir singing in four-part harmony, primarily homophonic with occasional polyphonic textures. The vocal range is broad, encompassing bass, baritone, tenor, and alto parts. The melody is stately and hymn-like, emphasizing clear articulation and sustained notes. The harmony is consonant, utilizing diatonic chords with occasional suspensions and resolutions that add to the solemnity. The production is clean, with a natural reverb that suggests a large performance space, enhancing the grandeur of the choir. There are no instrumental accompaniments, focusing entirely on the vocal performance. The dynamic range is moderate, with crescendos and decrescendos used to emphasize lyrical phrases. The overall feel is one of solemnity and devotion.",

    "songUrl": "https://suno.com/song/3582a790-fad0-4f76-8f81-af4624387fed",
    "style": "A dark, atmospheric electronic track with a driving beat and distorted male vocals. The song features a prominent synth bassline, a sustained synth pad, and a percussive element that sounds like a distorted kick drum or a low-frequency synth pulse. The tempo is moderate. The vocal delivery is a low-pitched, heavily distorted male voice, almost robotic, with a monotone quality. The song structure is repetitive, building tension through the layering of sounds and the consistent rhythmic pulse. There are no clear chord progressions, but rather sustained synth tones that create a dark, ambient backdrop. The production emphasizes a lo-fi, industrial feel with heavy distortion and a somewhat muffled mix. The overall mood is ominous and unsettling.",

Spacious reverb and delay create a sense of vast, cosmic atmosphere. Melodic synth leads glide over the texture with a futuristic, emotive tone. Subtle use of phased string-like synths and airy choirs for depth. Slow builds and breakdowns that feel cinematic and expansive, evoking outer space, technology, and timeless electronic soundscapes.",

The string section carries the main melody, which is characterized by long, sustained notes and a descending melodic contour. The brass section provides harmonic support and occasional counter-melodies, adding to the grandeur of the piece. Percussion, including timpani and cymbals, emphasizes key moments and adds to the overall dynamic range. The piece builds in intensity, with increasing instrumentation and dynamic levels, culminating in a powerful orchestral climax. The production emphasizes a wide stereo image and a rich, resonant sound.",

    "style": "A high-energy, instrumental electronic dance music track with a driving beat. The primary instruments are synthesizers, drums, and bass. The song features a consistent four-on-the-floor kick drum pattern, prominent snare hits on the two and four, and a pulsating bassline. Synthesizer melodies are bright and arpeggiated, creating a sense of forward motion. The track incorporates a build-up section with increasing intensity, leading to a drop. Production elements include reverb on synths, sidechain compression on the bass, and a clear, punchy mix.",

    "style": "A high-energy electronic dance music track with a driving beat and a prominent vocal sample. The song features a consistent four-on-the-floor kick drum pattern, a syncopated bassline, and a repetitive, catchy vocal loop. The tempo is fast, creating a sense of urgency and excitement. Production elements include heavy compression on the drums and bass, a slight reverb on the vocal sample, and a clean, punchy mix. The song structure is largely repetitive, building energy through the consistent groove rather than dramatic changes in instrumentation or melody. There are no discernible chord progressions, as the focus is on rhythmic interplay and the vocal sample. The key is ambiguous due to the lack of melodic instrumentation.",

    "style": "Dark, brooding rock ballad with sparse piano chords and deep, resonant baritone vocals. Slow, hypnotic tempo with minimal but deliberate percussion, often using toms and subtle cymbal swells instead of a full drum kit. Atmospheric layers of organ and droning strings create tension and cinematic depth. Bass is heavy, pulsing, and slightly distorted, anchoring the song with a sense of foreboding. Occasional bursts of jagged electric guitar provide grit and menace. Production is raw yet spacious, with reverb-drenched vocals sitting prominently in the mix, almost spoken at times, then swelling into dramatic intensity. The arrangement builds gradually, moving from intimate quietness to explosive crescendos of noise and emotion, before retreating back into silence.",

Prominent warm synth bass with rhythmic pluck patterns. Strategic farfisa organ stabs. Catchy staccato strings playing syncopated melodies and counter-melodies. Smooth layered synth chords with airy pads. Occasional piano and pizzicato strings for texture. Dynamic builds with filtered risers, handclaps, and energetic breakdowns. Clean, polished mix with wide stereo imaging. Tempo around 120 BPM, euphoric and uplifting mood.",

    "style": "A high-energy electronic dance track with a driving beat and a prominent synth melody. The song features a male vocalist with a clear, slightly processed voice, delivering a repetitive, almost hypnotic vocal line. The instrumentation includes a strong kick drum, a consistent hi-hat pattern, a pulsating bassline, and a bright, arpeggiated synth lead. The tempo is fast, contributing to the energetic feel. Production elements include a clean mix with clear separation between instruments, and a subtle reverb on the vocals. The song structure is repetitive, building intensity through the addition of layers and a consistent rhythmic drive.",

    "style": "A melancholic acoustic ballad in a minor key, featuring a male vocalist with a smooth, slightly melancholic tone. The song is characterized by a slow tempo and a gentle, fingerpicked acoustic guitar accompaniment that provides a warm, resonant foundation. The vocal melody is simple and expressive, emphasizing the emotional weight of the lyrics. Production elements include a clean, natural sound for the acoustic guitar, with subtle reverb on the vocals to create a sense of space. The song structure is verse-chorus, with instrumental breaks that allow the guitar to shine. The overall mood is reflective and somber, with a focus on the interplay between the vocal and the acoustic guitar.",

Features fingerpicked banjo, soft upright piano, warm analog strings (especially violins and violas), subtle woodwinds like flute and clarinet, and a light touch of glockenspiel for sparkle.

Emphasize simplicity and innocence, with a 1970s analog warmth and minimal percussion—just soft brushes on snare or very light cymbal swells, if any. The overall tone should be wistful, tender, and full of wonder.",

Driving drums with a crisp snare and syncopated hi-hats, groovy electric bass with slap and bounce, sharp staccato horn section (trumpet, sax, trombone) hitting tight rhythmic accents. Wah-wah rhythm guitar with choppy funk strumming. Classic Hammond B3 organ stabs and fills. Raw, live-band feel with call-and-response dynamics. Heavy emphasis on groove and danceable rhythm, with occasional drum breaks for signature funk screams. Vintage 60s/70s analog warmth and slight tape saturation. Keep it tight, punchy, and full of swagger.",

    "style": "A synth-pop track in A minor at 120 BPM, featuring a female vocalist. The song opens with a synth pad and a driving electronic drum beat. The verse introduces a clean electric guitar playing arpeggiated chords and a prominent synth bassline. The female vocals are delivered with a clear, slightly melancholic tone, utilizing a moderate amount of reverb. The chorus features a more layered synth arrangement, with a sustained synth pad providing harmonic support and a brighter synth melody. The vocal delivery in the chorus becomes more expansive and emotive. Production elements include sidechain compression on the synth pads, creating a pumping effect, and a subtle delay on the lead vocal. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus pattern with a bridge and an outro. The melody is primarily diatonic with occasional chromatic passing tones. The mix is clean and balanced, with the vocals sitting prominently in the foreground.",

Include gentle harp arpeggios and bright digital piano for melodic movement. Add subtle orchestral strings that swell and fade like waves. Use syncopated percussive elements such as light toms, electronic woodblocks, and ambient shakers—processed with heavy spatial effects. Employ multi-layered choral vocal pads (no lyrics) to emulate a stacked harmony sound. The tempo should be moderate and flowing (around 100 BPM), with smooth transitions and dynamic builds. Aim for a clean, polished 80s/early 90s new age production style with a touch of Celtic ambiance.",

    "style": "Slow, lush jazz ballad. Warm, intimate instrumentation featuring a full string section with sweeping legato lines, mellow upright bass, brushed jazz drums, and soft grand piano chords. Add subtle horn accents—muted trumpet and tenor saxophone—to complement the melody. The arrangement should be spacious and elegant, with a vintage analog feel. Emphasize a crooner-style vocal mix—dry and close, with just a hint of reverb for depth. Tempo around 65–75 BPM, with a romantic, nostalgic atmosphere.",

    "style": "Acoustic rock song in E minor at a moderate tempo of 120 BPM. The primary instrumentation consists of acoustic guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The acoustic guitar plays a prominent arpeggiated riff throughout the verses, transitioning to strummed chords in the chorus. The bass provides a walking bass line, and the drums maintain a steady rock beat with occasional fills. The male lead vocalist sings in a clear, slightly raspy baritone, employing a conversational tone in the verses and a more melodic, sustained delivery in the chorus. Production is clean with a natural reverb on the vocals and a balanced mix that highlights the acoustic elements. The song structure follows a verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus-outro pattern. The melody is diatonic, primarily within the E minor scale, with a focus on stepwise motion and small leaps. The chord progression in the verse is Em-C-G-D, and in the chorus, it shifts to C-G-D-Em. The bridge introduces a new progression of Am-Em-C-G. The overall feel is melancholic yet hopeful.",

    "style": "A blues-rock song with a shuffle rhythm, featuring a male vocalist, electric guitar, bass, and drums. The tempo is moderate, around 120 BPM. The song is in a major key, likely E major, with a prominent blues-based chord progression. The electric guitar plays a clean, slightly overdriven tone, providing rhythmic fills and a short, melodic solo. The bass provides a walking bass line, emphasizing the root and fifth of the chords. The drums maintain a shuffle beat with a strong backbeat on the snare. The male vocalist sings in a clear, slightly raspy voice, with a conversational and improvisational delivery. The song structure is loose, with repeated vocal phrases and instrumental breaks. Production elements include a natural room sound with minimal effects, giving it a live, raw feel. The mix is balanced, with the vocals and guitar prominent.",

The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The song is in a minor key, contributing to its somber mood. The tempo is moderate, allowing for clear articulation of the vocal melody and instrumental lines. The guitar plays a prominent role, providing both rhythmic support and melodic fills. The drums maintain a steady beat with occasional fills. The bass provides a solid foundation, often playing root notes. The vocal melody is relatively simple but effective, conveying emotion through its phrasing. Production elements include a clean mix with good separation between instruments, and a slight reverb on the vocals. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format with an instrumental bridge. The overall feel is introspective and slightly angsty.",

    "style": "Create a soaring, emotionally driven track inspired by Coldplay’s mid-to-late 2000s sound. Begin with a spacious, ambient piano melody with lots of reverb and delay, slowly joined by atmospheric pads and subtle synth textures. Add a clean electric guitar playing melodic arpeggios with shimmer and chorus effects, reminiscent of The Edge. Build momentum with a warm, rounded bassline and a driving but restrained drum groove—tight kick, snappy snare, and roomy tom fills. Use orchestral elements subtly—like rising string swells or distant horns—to lift the choruses. Keep the dynamics wide, starting intimately and blooming into a euphoric, stadium-ready crescendo. Overall mood should be hopeful, cinematic, and expansive.",

Strings should enter gradually, swelling for emotional moments and pulling back for intimacy. The mix should be clean and polished, with a focus on warmth and clarity. Keep the tempo moderate (~72–80 BPM), in a major or minor key depending on mood. Prioritize acoustic textures and dynamic builds, avoiding overproduction.",

    "style": "Acoustic folk rock song in 4/4 time at approximately 100 BPM. The song features a male vocalist with a clear, slightly raspy baritone voice. The primary instrumentation consists of an acoustic guitar playing a fingerpicked arpeggiated chord progression, providing a warm and intimate feel. A bass guitar provides a simple, supportive root-note line. The drums enter during the chorus, playing a straightforward rock beat with a strong backbeat on the snare. The song structure follows a verse-chorus pattern with a bridge. The melody is largely diatonic and memorable, sung in a comfortable mid-range. The production is clean, with the acoustic guitar prominent in the mix, and the vocals sitting clearly on top. There are no obvious effects on the vocals, maintaining a natural sound. The overall mood is reflective and slightly melancholic.",

    "style": "A high-energy electronic dance music track with a driving beat and a prominent synth melody. The song features a female vocalist with a clear, slightly processed voice. The instrumentation includes a strong kick drum, a consistent hi-hat pattern, a pulsating bassline, and various synthesized pads and arpeggios. The tempo is fast, creating a sense of urgency and excitement. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format with instrumental breaks and builds. Production elements include reverb on the vocals and synths, and a clear, punchy mix that emphasizes the rhythmic elements. The key appears to be minor, contributing to a slightly melancholic yet energetic feel. The melody is catchy and repetitive, designed for danceability. There are moments of dynamic contrast, with sections building in intensity before dropping back into a more groove-oriented feel.",

    "style": "A satirical musical piece in a cabaret or vaudeville style, featuring a male vocalist with a clear, theatrical baritone voice. The instrumentation includes a prominent piano, a string section providing sustained chords and melodic counterpoints, and a brass section with trombones and trumpets adding punchy accents. The tempo is moderate, and the key is major, creating a deceptively cheerful atmosphere. The song structure follows a verse-chorus pattern with instrumental breaks. The melody is singable and memorable, with a clear narrative progression. Production elements emphasize clarity of vocals and instruments, with a natural reverb that suggests a live performance space.",

    "style": "A male vocalist sings a narrative over a ragtime-inspired instrumental. The song is in a major key and maintains a consistent moderate tempo. The instrumentation features a piano playing a walking bass line and chordal accompaniment, a drum kit providing a swing rhythm with prominent snare and cymbal work, and a brass section with trombones and trumpets playing melodic fills and sustained chords. The vocal delivery is clear and conversational, with some spoken word elements. The production is clean, with a balanced mix that highlights both the vocals and the instrumental arrangement. The song structure follows a verse-chorus pattern with an instrumental break and a spoken word outro. The melody is largely diatonic and follows the chord changes. The overall feel is lighthearted and theatrical.",

    "style": "A melancholic ballad in a minor key, featuring a male tenor vocalist with a clear, slightly breathy delivery. The instrumentation includes a prominent piano playing arpeggiated chords and a sustained string section providing a lush, emotional backdrop. A subtle, almost imperceptible bass guitar provides a low-end foundation. The tempo is slow, contributing to the somber mood. The song structure is verse-chorus, with a clear melodic progression. The piano carries the primary melodic and harmonic information, while the strings add depth and sustain. The production emphasizes a clean, spacious mix, allowing each instrument to be clearly heard without clutter. There are no percussive elements, further enhancing the ballad's gentle and reflective character. The vocal melody is simple and expressive, following the chord changes with a natural, unforced quality. The overall feel is one of introspection and longing.",

    "style": "A high-energy rock song with a driving rhythm section, featuring a male lead vocalist with a raw, slightly distorted vocal quality. The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The guitar plays prominent riffs and fills throughout the song, often with a clean tone in the verses and a more overdriven sound in the choruses. The bass provides a strong, foundational groove. The drums maintain a consistent, energetic beat with frequent cymbal crashes. The song structure follows a verse-chorus format with a bridge and an instrumental break. The tempo is fast, and the key appears to be minor, contributing to a somewhat dark and intense mood. Production elements include a clear, punchy mix with a slight reverb on the vocals and guitars.",

The male vocalist sings in a clear, mid-range tenor, with some vocal layering in the chorus. The song structure includes verses, a pre-chorus, and a chorus. The tempo is moderate. The production is clean with a clear mix, emphasizing the guitars and vocals. There is a guitar solo after the second chorus. The song ends with a fade-out.",

    "style": "A high-energy rock song in a major key, featuring a male vocalist with a slightly raspy, mid-range voice. The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The electric guitar plays a prominent role with both rhythmic strumming and melodic lead lines, often incorporating a wah effect. The bass provides a driving, consistent rhythm. The drums maintain a steady, upbeat tempo with a strong backbeat. The song structure includes verses, a chorus, and instrumental breaks. The vocal delivery is energetic and conversational, with some spoken-word elements. Production elements include a clear mix with the vocals prominent, and a slight reverb on the vocals and guitars.",

    "style": "A high-energy rock song with a driving rhythm section, distorted guitars, and a male vocalist. The song features a consistent tempo of 140 BPM and is in the key of E minor. The instrumentation includes a drum kit with prominent snare and cymbal work, a bass guitar providing a strong low-end foundation, and two electric guitars: one playing a rhythmic, distorted riff and the other providing melodic leads and fills. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format with instrumental breaks. The vocals are delivered by a male singer with a raw, slightly strained quality, often employing a call-and-response dynamic with the lead guitar. Production elements include heavy distortion on the guitars, a clear and punchy drum mix, and a forward vocal presence. The overall feel is aggressive and anthemic.",

    "style": "A high-energy rock song with a driving rhythm section, distorted guitars, and a male lead vocalist. The song features a consistent tempo of 140 BPM and is in the key of E minor. The drum pattern is characterized by a strong backbeat and frequent snare fills. The bass guitar provides a solid, rhythmic foundation with a slightly overdriven tone. Electric guitars play both rhythmic power chords and melodic lead lines, often with a wah effect. The lead vocal is clean and upfront in the mix, delivered with a slightly raw, energetic quality. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format with a bridge and an instrumental break. Production is clean with a focus on instrumental clarity and vocal presence. Reverb is used subtly on vocals and guitars to add depth.",

The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The electric guitar plays distorted power chords and melodic riffs. The bass guitar provides a strong, foundational low end. The drums feature a consistent rock beat with prominent snare and kick drum. The male vocals are delivered with a raw, powerful quality, often in a mid-range register. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format, with an instrumental bridge. Production elements include a clear, punchy mix with a focus on the guitar and vocals. There is a noticeable reverb on the vocals and a slight delay on some guitar parts. The overall feel is energetic and intense.",

    "style": "A high-energy punk rock track with a driving rhythm section and prominent guitar riffs. The song is in a major key, likely E major, with a fast tempo around 180 BPM. The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The electric guitar features a distorted tone, playing both rhythmic power chords and melodic lead lines. The bass guitar provides a strong, consistent root-note foundation. The drums maintain a steady, driving beat with frequent cymbal crashes and snare fills. The male lead vocalist sings with a raw, slightly strained quality, delivering lyrics in a clear, forward-mixed manner. The vocal melody is largely syllabic and follows the chord progression. The song structure includes distinct verse and chorus sections, with an instrumental break featuring a guitar solo. Production elements include a relatively dry mix, emphasizing the raw energy of the instruments and vocals. There is a slight reverb on the vocals and guitars, contributing to a live, energetic feel. The overall dynamic range is compressed, maintaining a consistent loudness throughout the track.",

    "style": "A high-energy, fast-paced electronic track with prominent synth melodies and a driving beat. The tempo is approximately 140 BPM. The primary instruments are synthesizers, drums, and a bassline. The drums feature a consistent kick drum on every beat, a snare on the off-beats, and a closed hi-hat pattern. The bassline is a continuous, pulsing synth bass. The main melody is played by a bright, arpeggiated synth, creating a sense of urgency and excitement. There are no traditional chord progressions, but rather a continuous melodic and rhythmic texture. The production is clean and punchy, with a focus on clarity of individual synth lines. The song structure is largely repetitive, building intensity through layering of synth elements and subtle rhythmic variations. There are no vocals present in this piece.",

    "style": "A male vocalist sings a melancholic rock song with a driving rhythm section. The song is in a minor key, likely E minor, with a tempo of approximately 120 BPM. The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The electric guitar plays a clean, arpeggiated melody during the verses and a distorted, power-chord driven riff during the chorus. The bass provides a steady, walking line. The drums feature a consistent rock beat with prominent snare hits. The male vocals are clean and clear, with a slightly melancholic tone. The vocal melody is relatively simple and follows the chord progression. The song structure is verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus-outro. Production elements include a clear mix with the vocals prominent, and a slight reverb on the guitar and vocals.",

The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The guitar plays distorted power chords and melodic riffs. The bass provides a solid, driving low end, and the drums maintain a fast, consistent beat with prominent snare hits. The song has a relatively simple chord progression, typical of punk, focusing on energy and directness. The production is raw, with a slightly lo-fi feel, emphasizing the band's live sound. The tempo is fast, contributing to the urgent feel of the track. The song structure is verse-chorus based, with a clear distinction between sections. There are no complex melodic lines, rather the melody is carried by the vocal line and simple guitar riffs. The overall feel is rebellious and energetic.",

    "style": "A soulful female vocal performance with a bluesy, gospel-influenced feel. The instrumentation features a prominent acoustic guitar playing a fingerpicked accompaniment, a subtle bass guitar providing a warm foundation, and a drum kit with a light, brushed snare sound. The vocal melody is expressive and uses melisma. The song is in a major key and has a moderate tempo. Production elements include a natural reverb on the vocals and a balanced mix that highlights the acoustic instruments.",

    "style": "A melancholic indie folk song in a minor key, featuring a female vocalist with a clear, slightly breathy tone. The instrumentation includes acoustic guitar, piano, and a subtle string section. The tempo is slow, creating a reflective atmosphere. The chord progression is simple, emphasizing the emotional weight of the melody. The production is clean, with a focus on the natural sound of the instruments and vocals. The song structure follows a traditional verse-chorus format, with a bridge providing a slight dynamic shift. The melody is memorable and haunting, with a narrow vocal range that enhances the intimate feel of the song. The piano provides a gentle arpeggiated accompaniment, while the strings add warmth and depth to the overall sound. The acoustic guitar plays a simple strumming pattern, providing a rhythmic foundation.",

    "style": "A high-energy rock song with a driving rhythm section, prominent electric guitars, and a male lead vocalist. The song is in a major key, likely E major, and maintains a fast tempo throughout. The instrumentation includes a drum kit providing a strong backbeat, a bass guitar laying down a consistent root-note foundation, and multiple electric guitars playing both rhythmic chords and melodic riffs. One guitar often plays a clean, arpeggiated riff during verses, while distorted power chords dominate the choruses. The lead vocal is a clear, mid-range male voice with a slightly raw, rock-oriented quality. Production elements include a relatively dry mix with some reverb on the vocals and guitars, giving it a live, energetic feel. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus form with a pre-chorus build-up and an instrumental break. The melody is catchy and memorable, often featuring syncopated rhythms.",

    "style": "A male vocalist sings over a rock arrangement. The song is in a minor key and has a moderate tempo. The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The electric guitar plays a clean, arpeggiated melody during the verses and a distorted, power chord-driven riff during the chorus. The bass guitar provides a solid rhythmic and harmonic foundation. The drums play a straightforward rock beat with a strong backbeat. The vocals are delivered with a melancholic tone, transitioning to a more impassioned delivery in the chorus. Production elements include a clear mix with a slight reverb on the vocals and guitars. The song structure follows a verse-chorus pattern with an instrumental break.",

    "style": "The song is a high-energy punk rock track with a driving rhythm section. The tempo is fast, around 180 BPM. The key is A minor. The instrumentation includes a distorted electric guitar, a prominent bass guitar, and a drum kit. The guitar plays power chords and single-note riffs, often with a palm-muted attack. The bass provides a strong, melodic foundation, often mirroring the guitar's root notes but also adding fills. The drums feature a consistent, driving beat with frequent snare drum accents and cymbal crashes, particularly on the downbeats. The male lead vocalist sings with a raw, slightly strained quality, delivering lyrics in a rapid-fire, almost spoken-word style during verses, transitioning to a more melodic, shouted delivery in the chorus. There are no complex chord progressions; the song primarily relies on a simple, repetitive punk rock structure using minor chords and dominant seventh chords. The production is raw and unpolished, with a focus on the aggressive energy of the instruments. The mix emphasizes the drums and vocals, with the guitar and bass providing a solid, driving wall of sound. There are no obvious vocal effects beyond a slight reverb. The song structure is verse-chorus, with an instrumental break featuring a guitar solo that is more melodic than technical, followed by a final chorus and outro. The guitar solo is short and punchy, utilizing bends and vibrato. The outro features a sustained guitar chord fading out.",

The electric guitar plays a clean, arpeggiated melody during the intro and verses, transitioning to a distorted, power chord-driven riff during the chorus. The bass guitar provides a steady, rhythmic foundation, often playing root notes and simple melodic lines. The drums maintain a consistent beat with a strong emphasis on the snare drum, particularly during the chorus sections. The song features a male vocalist with a clear, slightly melancholic tone. His vocal delivery is mostly clean, with some subtle vocal effects like reverb. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format, with an instrumental intro, two verses, two choruses, an instrumental bridge, and a final chorus that fades out. The chord progression is primarily minor, contributing to the overall somber feel. The production emphasizes a clear separation of instruments, with the guitar and vocals prominent in the mix. There is a noticeable use of reverb on the vocals and some delay on the guitar during the intro and verses.",

The song features a male lead vocalist with a clear, slightly raspy baritone voice. The vocal delivery is expressive and dynamic, ranging from conversational to more powerful and sustained notes. The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The electric guitar plays both rhythmic chords and melodic lead lines. The bass provides a solid foundation with a walking bass line in some sections. The drums maintain a consistent rock beat with a strong backbeat. The song structure includes verses, a pre-chorus, and a chorus. The verses are characterized by a more subdued vocal delivery and a less dense instrumental arrangement. The pre-chorus builds tension with a rising vocal melody and increasing instrumental intensity. The chorus is the most energetic part of the song, featuring a full instrumental arrangement and a more anthemic vocal melody. There are also instrumental breaks and a guitar solo. The production is clean and balanced, with all instruments clearly audible. The guitar has a slightly overdriven tone. The vocals are mixed prominently in the foreground. The overall feel is melancholic yet powerful.",

    "style": "The song is a male vocal-led acoustic rock piece with a strong emphasis on guitar and bass, The tempo is moderate, and the key is major, The song features a clear verse-chorus structure with an instrumental break, The lead vocal is a baritone male, delivered in a conversational, slightly nasal tone, with some spoken word elements, The acoustic guitar provides a consistent rhythmic and harmonic foundation, primarily strumming chords, The bass guitar plays a simple, supportive root-note line, There are no drums or percussion, The production is clean and dry, with minimal effects, giving the song an intimate, live feel, The chorus introduces a more melodic vocal line and a slightly more dynamic guitar strumming pattern, The instrumental break features a simple acoustic guitar solo that mirrors the vocal melody of the chorus, The overall mood is lighthearted and slightly humorous. The vocalist is competent but not virtuosic.\n",

    "style": "The song is a male vocal-led rock ballad with a melancholic and introspective mood. The tempo is slow, around 60-70 BPM. The key is minor, likely A minor or a related minor key, contributing to the somber atmosphere. The instrumentation features a clean electric guitar playing arpeggiated chords, a sustained synth pad providing atmospheric backing, and a male lead vocal. The drums enter later in the song, providing a simple, steady beat with a kick, snare, and closed hi-hat. The bass guitar plays a simple, sustained root-note line. The vocal delivery is soft and breathy, with a slightly melancholic tone. There are no prominent vocal harmonies or ad-libs in the initial sections. The song structure follows a verse-chorus pattern, with instrumental breaks. The production is clean, with a clear separation of instruments. The guitar has a slight reverb, and the vocals are mixed prominently with a subtle reverb. The overall dynamic range is relatively narrow, maintaining a consistent emotional intensity.",

Instrumentation features lively piano, playful strings, light synth textures, and a dynamic rhythm section. Builds to a soaring, hopeful chorus with a key change that feels like taking flight. A wide-eyed anthem of discovery and belonging. The song is entirely in major key.",

The primary instruments are a ukulele providing the main rhythmic and harmonic foundation, and a bass guitar playing a simple, supportive line. There is also a light percussion track featuring a kick drum and snare, providing a steady, driving beat. The vocals are performed by a young female singer with a clear, bright tone. The melody is simple and memorable, following the chord changes closely. The song is in a major key and has a moderate tempo. The production is clean and straightforward, with the ukulele and vocals prominent in the mix.",

The guitar features a clean, slightly reverbed tone with arpeggiated patterns in the verses and more sustained chords in the chorus. The bass provides a solid, melodic foundation. The drums feature a consistent kick and snare pattern with prominent hi-hats. The male vocals are delivered in a clear, slightly melancholic tone, with a relatively narrow range. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format with an instrumental break. The key is E minor and the tempo is approximately 120 BPM. Production is clean with a focus on clarity of each instrument.",

    "style": "The song is a rock track featuring a male vocalist with a baritone range. The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The guitar provides a distorted, heavy tone throughout the song, playing both rhythmic power chords and melodic lead lines. The bass guitar provides a driving, foundational low end. The drums feature a consistent rock beat with prominent snare hits and cymbal crashes. The song structure consists of verses and a chorus. The vocal melody is relatively simple and follows the chord progression. The tempo is moderate. The overall production is raw and energetic, with the distorted guitar being a prominent element in the mix. There are no obvious effects on the vocals beyond standard mixing techniques.",

    "style": "The piece is a rock song in a minor key, featuring a male vocalist with a baritone range. The instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. The guitar provides a distorted, driving riff throughout the song, particularly prominent during the verses and chorus. The bassline is simple and follows the root notes of the chords. The drums provide a steady, mid-tempo beat with a strong backbeat on the snare. The song structure consists of verses and a chorus, with instrumental breaks featuring guitar solos. The vocals are delivered with a raw, slightly strained quality, particularly in the higher register during the chorus. There are vocal ad-libs present, primarily in the form of shouts and extended vowel sounds. The production is somewhat raw, with the instruments mixed to create a powerful, slightly lo-fi sound. The overall feel is energetic and slightly angsty.",

It features a prominent, distorted electric guitar riff that repeats throughout the song, providing a strong melodic and rhythmic hook.  The drums are electronic, with a consistent kick drum pattern and a snare that emphasizes the backbeat.  There is a synth bassline that provides a deep, pulsing foundation.  The tempo is moderately fast.  The overall production is clean and punchy, with the guitar mixed forward.  There are no traditional chord progressions in the sense of changing chords; the piece is built around the repeating guitar riff and bassline.  The structure is repetitive, with the main musical idea looping.  There are no vocals.",

Sections jump from explosive EDM \"jump up\" drops to cumbia-inspired rhythms, peppered with Greek laiko scales. Percussion blends with Massada dub flourishes, Baratta disco bass lines, and playful brass. Funky “eat beat” grooves support danceable verses, while “smoke-time” and “down-fizz” bridges introduce psychedelic slowdowns with hazy guitar, deep echo, and crisp Latin percussion. Switch-ups introduce bold “cholando” outbursts—syncopated group vocals, dizzying FX, and a wild, festival-ready finale in the style of \"verziskos,\" fusing everything in a breakneck K-pop coda.",

The guitar features distorted tones and prominent riffs throughout the song. The bass provides a solid foundation, often following the guitar riffs. The drums provide a consistent, powerful beat with frequent use of crash cymbals. The vocals are delivered by a male vocalist with a raw, slightly strained quality, particularly in the higher register. The vocal melody is largely anthemic and repetitive in the chorus. The song structure includes verses, a chorus, and an instrumental break. The overall production is loud and somewhat compressed, emphasizing the raw energy of the performance. There is a significant amount of reverb on the vocals and some delay effects on the guitar.",

The vocals are delivered by a male singer with a baritone range, employing a clean vocal technique with some emotional intensity.  The song structure includes verses and a chorus.  There are also instrumental sections featuring guitar solos.  Production includes reverb on the vocals and guitars, creating a sense of space.

Glitchy synths evolve in texture, culminating in a glitch-pop climax with a frenetic electronic polka rhythm. Intimate, clean male vocals float through, contrasted by lucid acoustic breaks. Transitions feature arpeggiated strings and synths. The mix is dry, sparse, and airy, ending with a fragile, minimal coda.",

    "style": "Rocksteady groove starts the track—tight, punchy bass, offbeat guitar, and crisp drums. Bright synths and bold future bass swells add modern flair. Verses feature raggamuffin-style vocals over fingerpicked guitar. Krautrock synth textures propel the bridge. An explosive jump up-style breakdown and a dynamic bouzouki solo bring surprise. Polished 2020s K-pop/J-pop-inspired production unites catchy hooks, big stabs, and sharp transitions.",

The instrumentation primarily features synthesizers creating pads, arpeggios, and basslines, along with a prominent drum machine providing a steady four-on-the-floor rhythm with occasional fills. The chord progression is consistent throughout the main sections, creating a sense of forward motion. The male lead vocal is smooth and slightly melancholic, delivered with a clear tone and some subtle effects like reverb. The song structure includes distinct verse and chorus sections, with instrumental breaks that maintain the overall energy. The melody is memorable and follows the chord changes closely. The key appears to be minor, contributing to the emotional depth. The tempo is moderately fast. Production elements include a clear mix with the vocals prominent, and the electronic elements well-balanced. There are also some atmospheric sound effects that enhance the mood.",

The electric guitar features a distorted tone and plays both rhythmic power chords and melodic lead lines. The bass guitar provides a solid foundation with a consistent, often root-note-based pattern. The drums provide a strong backbeat with prominent snare hits and frequent cymbal crashes, particularly during transitions and more intense sections. The song structure appears to be based around repeating sections with variations in intensity and guitar lead work. There are no vocals. The production is clean with a focus on the instrumental interplay. The overall feel is energetic and powerful.",

The piano provides the main harmonic structure with arpeggiated chords and a simple, repeating melody. The strings offer a lush, emotional layer, primarily playing sustained chords and counter-melodies. The bass guitar provides a steady, foundational rhythm and harmonic support. The drums are understated, focusing on a simple beat with brushes or light sticks, emphasizing the ballad feel. The female vocalist has a clear, slightly breathy tone, delivering the melody with a sense of longing and vulnerability. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format with an instrumental bridge. The tempo is slow, and the key appears to be in a minor mode, contributing to the overall sad mood. Production is clean with a focus on balancing the vocal and piano, allowing the strings to swell and recede to enhance the emotional arc.",

Verses layer Cape Verdean piano rhythms, subtle highlife guitars, and a harpsichord run. Tin whistle floats over a nu gaze-inspired chorus, rich in reverb and swirling motifs. Thick, lush pads and phased guitars deepen the production, with a reflective middle-eight that interweaves space music ambiance. Final verse crescendos with layered harmonies and vibrant instrumental interplay.",

The male vocalist sings with a clear, slightly melancholic tone, utilizing a mix of chest and head voice. The melody is simple and follows the chord progression closely.

The primary instrumentation consists of acoustic guitar playing a fingerpicked pattern and a harmonica providing melodic lines and fills. The guitar maintains a consistent rhythm and harmonic structure throughout the verses and instrumental breaks. The harmonica enters after the initial guitar intro and plays a bluesy melody, often mirroring or responding to the vocal phrases. The male vocal is delivered in a conversational, slightly gravelly tone, with a relaxed and somewhat melancholic quality. The melody is relatively simple and follows the chord changes directly. The song structure appears to be verse-based with instrumental breaks featuring the harmonica. There are no drums or bass, giving the track a sparse, intimate feel. The production is dry with minimal effects, emphasizing the natural sound of the acoustic instruments and vocal. The key appears to be in a minor key, contributing to the melancholic mood. The tempo is steady and unhurried.",

The chord progression is a repeating Dm-C-G-Dm sequence. The male lead vocal is clean and centered in the mix, with a clear, storytelling quality. There is minimal processing on the vocal, likely just some light compression and EQ. The guitar is mixed slightly to the left and right, creating a subtle stereo field. No other instruments or percussive elements are present. The overall production is sparse and intimate.",

The key appears to be a minor key, possibly A minor or E minor, with a chord progression featuring minor and major chords. The instrumentation consists of a fingerpicked acoustic guitar providing the harmonic and rhythmic foundation throughout. A male baritone vocal delivers the lead melody, generally staying within a comfortable range.  A basic drum kit enters, providing a steady backbeat and simple fills. An electric bass guitar reinforces the root notes of the chords, adding weight to the low end.  Guitar fills, likely acoustic, accent the end of vocal phrases. The mix is relatively dry, with minimal effects, emphasizing the acoustic instruments and vocal clarity.  The song structure is verse-based with repeating melodic ideas.",

Production includes layering of instruments and a build-up in energy and density. The dynamics range from quiet and sparse in the intro to loud and full later on.",

    "style": "The track is a mid-tempo R&B piece at approximately 80 BPM in the key of D minor. It features a simple, four-on-the-floor drum machine beat with a snare on beats 2 and 4, and occasional open hi-hats. An electric bass plays a groovy, repeating four-bar phrase using primarily root notes and passing tones. Synthesized pads or soft keys provide harmonic backing. The main melodic elements are delivered by a male baritone vocalist with a smooth, intimate delivery, occasionally incorporating a breathy falsetto and ad-libs. The song structure consists of verses and choruses. Production is clean with a focus on vocal clarity and a warm, round bass tone. Reverb is used subtly on the vocals and pads.",

    "style": "This is a slow tempo indie pop track in a minor key, likely C# minor, with a time signature of 4/4.  The primary instrumentation includes a grand piano playing a repeated arpeggiated chord progression throughout the verse and a more sustained chordal pattern in the chorus. A string section provides sustained pads and melodic lines, enhancing the emotional quality. A basic drum kit provides a simple kick and snare pattern. The male lead vocal is baritone with a rich tone and a relatively close mic'd presence, exhibiting a moderate amount of reverb. There are clear verse and chorus sections with distinct changes in instrumentation and rhythmic feel. The mix is balanced with the vocals and piano being most prominent, followed by the strings and drums.",

The primary instrumentation is acoustic guitar, strummed with a consistent eighth-note pattern providing harmonic support. A piano plays eighth-note arpeggiated figures and occasional melodic lines, adding a counterpoint to the guitar. A bass guitar provides a simple root-note driven bassline on the quarter notes.  The male vocals are a clear baritone with a natural, slightly dry production, centered in the stereo field. The vocal melody is relatively simple and follows the chord changes. There's some subtle reverb on the vocals and instruments to create a sense of space. The structure consists of verses and a recurring chorus, with instrumental sections featuring the guitar and piano.",

    "style": "The piece is in the genre of alternative rock with a focus on a heavy, distorted electric guitar tone and a tight rhythm section of bass guitar and drums. The drums provide a consistent, driving beat with prominent snare hits and cymbal crashes. The bass guitar provides a solid foundation, following the root notes of the guitar chords. The electric guitar features heavy distortion and employs power chords during the main sections and more melodic single-note lines during transitions or fills. The male lead vocal is in the baritone range and is mixed prominently, featuring a clear, present quality with some subtle reverb applied. The song structure follows a typical verse-chorus format. The key is likely E minor, and the tempo is around 128 BPM. The production features a wide stereo image with instruments well-separated. There is some overall compression applied to the mix, giving it a powerful and cohesive sound. There is a noticeable build-up at the beginning with filtered instrumentation gradually becoming clearer and louder.",

Clipping drum-machine hits—an aluminum-slap snare and a boxy kick—punch awkwardly against rigid, over-quantized hi-hats. A muddy synth bass wanders unpredictably under a conflicting sub-drone. Randomly panned elements clutter the mix: a hallway-sounding acoustic guitar hard left, a lagging pan-flute preset hard right. The chorus tries to explode but collapses into clashing pads, stuttering brass samples, and a cheesy workstation-style choir, all aggressively side-chained into a nauseating pump. A failing square-wave lead struggles through a forced key change before the track cuts off abruptly, like the DAW crashed mid-render.",
